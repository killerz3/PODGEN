# PodGenðŸ“»

[PodGen](https://huggingface.co/spaces/killerz3/PodGen) is a Python and Gradio project designed to generate podcast-style conversations between two characters, Alice and Bob. This allows users to better understand topics, especially those who retain information better through auditory means rather than reading.

## Features

- **Easy Podcast Generation:** Simplify the creation of podcast episodes with a step-by-step interface.
- **Vast Knowledge:** PodGen uses Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 for content generation, providing high-quality material.
- **Human Voice:** Using Microsoft's edge-tts, it can create human-like voices effortlessly on a CPU.
